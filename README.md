# Classroom-Chatbot
A chatbot that allows teachers to upload their documents so that students can ask questions and receive answers based on the content. This project is built using the Docker GenAI Stack, which leverages modern AI tools like LangChain, Neo4j, and Ollama to create a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot.
